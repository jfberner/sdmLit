The goal of sdmTools is to allow easy implementation of methods not implemented in the sdm package, using the standard outputs of the sdm:: functions. The methods are all described in the literature, and are usually not compiled in any single package, which leads to very long coding and implementing sessions. The author felt ENM analyses and mapping currently sparsed in the literature could be centralized in a single package.

There are three currently working "branches" in the package. Namely, 1) Boyce Index @hirzelEvaluatingAbilityHabitat2006, 2) consistency/congruence maps @morales-barberoInputMattersMatter2019a and 3) Accumulation of Occurrences Curve @jimenezLeavingAreaReceiving2020a.

Below, I do my best to explain when/why use each of these and give examples of usage with the standard outputs from the sdm package, mainly from sdm() and predict().

## Installation

You can install the development version of sdmTools from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jfberner/sdmTools")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(sdmTools)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
