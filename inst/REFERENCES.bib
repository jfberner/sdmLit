  abstract = {A resource selection function (RSF) is any model that yields values proportional to the probability of use of a resource unit. RSF models often are fitted using generalized linear models (GLMs) although a variety of statistical models might be used. Information criteria such as the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) are tools that can be useful for selecting a model from a set of biologically plausible candidates. Statistical inference procedures, such as the likelihood-ratio test, can be used to assess whether models deviate from random null models. But for most applications of RSF models, usefulness is evaluated by how well the model predicts the location of organisms on a landscape. Predictions from RSF models constructed using presence/absence (used/unused) data can be evaluated using procedures developed for logistic regression, such as confusion matrices, Kappa statistics, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. However, RSF models estimated from presence/available data create unique problems for evaluating model predictions. For presence/available models we propose a form of k-fold cross validation for evaluating prediction success. This involves calculating the correlation between RSF ranks and area-adjusted frequencies for a withheld sub-sample of data. A similar approach can be applied to evaluate predictive success for out-of-sample data. Not all RSF models are robust for application in different times or different places due to ecological and behavioral variation of the target organisms.},

Here we introduce MERRAclim, a global set of satellite-based bioclimatic variables including Antarctica for the first time. MERRAclim consists of three datasets of 19 bioclimatic variables that have been built for each of the last three decades (1980s, 1990s and 2000s) using hourly data of 2\,m temperature and specific humidity. We provide MERRAclim at three spatial resolutions (10 arc-minutes, 5 arc-minutes and 2.5 arc-minutes).

  abstract = {Bird migration patterns are changing worldwide due to current global climate changes. Addressing the effects of such changes on the migration of birds in South America is particularly challenging because the details about how birds migrate within the Neotropics are generally not well understood. Here, we aim to infer the potential effects of future climate change on breeding and wintering areas of birds that migrate within South America by estimating the size and elevations of their future breeding and wintering areas. We used occurrence data from species distribution databases (VertNet and GBIF), published studies, and eBird for 3 thrush species (Turdidae; Turdus nigriceps, T. subalaris, and T. flavipes) that breed and winter in different regions of South America and built ecological niche models using ensemble forecasting approaches to infer current and future potential distributions throughout the breeding and wintering periods of each species. Our findings point to future shifts in wintering and breeding areas, mainly through elevational and longitudinal changes. Future breeding areas for T. nigriceps, which migrates along the Andes Mountains, will be displaced to the west, while breeding displacements to the east are expected for the other 2 species. An overall loss in the size of future wintering areas was also supported for 2 of the species, especially for T. subalaris, but an increase is anticipated for T. flavipes. Our results suggest that future climate change in South America will require that species shift their breeding and wintering areas to higher elevations in addition to changes in their latitudes and longitude. Our findings are the first to show how future climate change may affect migratory birds in South America throughout the year and suggest that even closely related migratory birds in South America will be affected in different ways, depending on the regions where they breed and overwinter.\textbullet{} Bird ranges are changing worldwide due to current global climate changes.\textbullet{} Bird migration is common in South America, with more than 200 species of Neotropical austral migrants, yet we still understand little about how these species are impacted by climate change.\textbullet{} We modeled future breeding and winter distributions of 3 species of migratory thrushes in South America.\textbullet{} Our results suggest that future wintering and breeding areas for migratory birds in South America will decrease, change in latitude and longitude, and shift to higher regions although patterns will likely vary by species.},

Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5\textendash 15\% (0.07\textendash 0.17 \textdegree C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were {$\geq$} 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

  abstract = {Models predicting species spatial distribution are increasingly applied to wildlife management issues, emphasising the need for reliable methods to evaluate the accuracy of their predictions. As many available datasets (e.g. museums, herbariums, atlas) do not provide reliable information about species absences, several presence-only based analyses have been developed. However, methods to evaluate the accuracy of their predictions are few and have never been validated. The aim of this paper is to compare existing and new presence-only evaluators to usual presence/absence measures. We use a reliable, diverse, presence/absence dataset of 114 plant species to test how common presence/absence indices (Kappa, MaxKappa, AUC, adjusted D2) compare to presence-only measures (AVI, CVI, Boyce index) for evaluating generalised linear models (GLM). Moreover we propose a new, threshold-independent evaluator, which we call ``continuous Boyce index''. All indices were implemented in the BIOMAPPER software. We show that the presence-only evaluators are fairly correlated ({$\rho>$}0.7) to the presence/absence ones. The Boyce indices are closer to AUC than to MaxKappa and are fairly insensitive to species prevalence. In addition, the Boyce indices provide predicted-to-expected ratio curves that offer further insights into the model quality: robustness, habitat suitability resolution and deviation from randomness. This information helps reclassifying predicted maps into meaningful habitat suitability classes. The continuous Boyce index is thus both a complement to usual evaluation of presence/absence models and a reliable measure of presence-only based predictions.},

We present a probabilistic treatment of the presence-only problem and derive a method to assess the performance of SDMs based on the analysis of an area-presence plot and the SDM outputs represented in both geographic and environmental spaces. We show how our method is useful to solve the two main tasks for which the AUC is used: assessing the performance of an SDM and comparing the performance of different SDMs. Our results build on previous work and constitute a rigorous method for assessing the performance of SDMs in relation to a random classifier. We establish comparisons with two of the most popular approaches used to assess the performance of an SDM, the AUC and the Boyce index, and identified cases in which our method has advantages over these two approaches. We suggest that the performance of an algorithm that classifies presence-only data can be assessed by two factors: (a) the degree of non-randomness of the classification at every step in the accumulation curve of presences, and (b) the amount of uninformative niche space used for the classification. The method we developed can be applied to any SDM output by using the R functions available at: https://github.com/LauraJim/SDM-hyperTest.},

The resulting data consist of a monthly temperature and precipitation climatology for the years 1979-2013.

  abstract = {Accuracy of global bioclimatic databases is essential to understand biodiversity\textendash environment relationships. Many studies have explored biases and uncertainties related to species distribution models (SDMs) but the effect of choosing a specific database among the different alternatives has not been previously assessed. The lack of bioclimatic congruence (degree of agreement) between different databases is a main concern in distribution modelling and it is critical in single-source models, for which the database choice is decisive. In order to prevent unreliable predictions derived from distorted input data, SDMs accuracy can be assessed by mapping model predictions according to a bioclimatic congruence measure derived from the comparison of multiple databases, which can be achieved with the bioclimatic consistency maps that we propose in this study. Here, (a) we present the first global-scale bioclimatic congruence map to analyse environmental mismatches between recently updated bioclimatic databases. We also test the importance of input matters on the reliability of distribution models of sixteen mammals, by addressing (b) inconsistencies among species response curves (temperature and precipitation), and (c) discrepancies among SDMs predictions depending on the chosen bioclimatic database. Finally, (d) we propose a strategy to assess bioclimatic consistency of model predictions, showing its application to the specific case of Litocranius walleri. Our results confirm that the single-source modelling approach greatly influences the estimation of species\textendash environment relationship and consequently, bias spatial predictions derived from SDMs. This is especially true for studies conducted in polar and mountainous regions which showed the smallest bioclimatic congruence. We show that by adding bioclimatic congruence to SDMs projections, we can build a bioclimatic consistency map that enables the detection of both risky and consistent areas, as revealed for the case of L. walleri. Assessing uncertainty in bioclimatic input data is key to avoid erroneous conclusions in macroecological and biogeographical studies. The spatial characterization of bioclimatic consistency provides an adequate empirical framework which effectively illustrates bioclimatic data limitations. We strongly recommend that this new strategy should be formally and systematically incorporated into distribution modelling to build more reliable SDMs, which are essential to develop successful biodiversity conservation programmes.},

  abstract = {Ecological niche models are widely used in terrestrial studies to address critical ecological and evolutionary questions related to past and future climate change, local adaptation and speciation, the discovery of rare endemics, and biological invasions. However the application of niche models to similar questions in marine ecosystems has lagged behind, in part due to the lack of a centralized high-resolution spatial data set representing both benthic and pelagic marine environments. Here we describe the creation of MARSPEC, a high-resolution GIS database of ocean climate layers intended for marine ecological niche modeling and other applications in marine spatial ecology. MARSPEC combines information related to topographic complexity of the seafloor with bioclimatic measures of sea surface temperature and salinity for the world ocean. We derived seven geophysical variables from a high-resolution raster grid representing depth of the seafloor (bathymetry) to characterize six facets of topographic complexity (east\textendash west and north\textendash south components of aspect, slope, concavity of the seafloor, and plan and profile curvature) and distance from shore. We further derived 10 bioclimatic variables describing the annual mean, range, variance, and extreme values for temperature and salinity from long-term monthly climatological means obtained from remotely sensed and in situ oceanographic observations. All variables were clipped to a common land mask, interpolated to a nominal 1-km (30 arc-second) grid, and converted to an ESRI raster grid file format compatible with popular GIS programs. MARSPEC is a 10-fold improvement in spatial resolution over the next-best data set (Bio-ORACLE) and is the only high-resolution global marine data set to combine variables from the benthic and pelagic environments into a single database. Additionally, we provide the monthly climatological layers used to derive the bioclimatic variables, allowing users to calculate equivalent MARSPEC variables from anomaly data for past and future climate scenarios. A detailed description of GIS processing steps required to calculate the MARSPEC variables can be found in the metadata.},

The Andean uplift and drastic climate changes along the Eocene/Miocene resulted in the formation of a drier area separating AM from AF. However, multiple evidences have indicated recurrent connections between Neotropical rainforests during Quaternary. In this study we predict biogeographical connections between Neotropical Forests during the last glacial maximum (LGM\textemdash 21~ka) and establish the climatic conditions that favored such connections. We tested if the general climatic conditions suitable to both Amazon (AM) and AF were uniform across current Cerrado and Caatinga areas or did subsets of these climatic spaces have independent spatial displacements connecting specific regions of AM and AF. For these, 50 occurrence points equidistant in the climatic space were sampled along the western and eastern AM and northern and southern AF and used to built ecological niche models (ENM) for each region. Potential distributions were predicted for the current and the LGM climatic scenarios using an ensemble approach. The ENMs detected the disjunct distribution of the two Neotropical rainforests in the present and showed three main connections during LGM: (1) climate suitable to western AM were detected along the northern coast of Brazil, overlapping the putative distribution of northern AF; (2) climates suitable to southern AF, northern AF and western AM were detected along the area now occupied by southern limits of the Caatinga and (3) the climate suitable to southern AF was found at the south limits of the eastern AM. Our findings suggest that subsets of both AM and AF may be considered distinct biogeographical units as implied by different responses to climate changes.},

This study aims to understand the current conservation status of Actinote quadra, a neotropical threatened butterfly species, as well as predict how it will be in the future. By coupling ecological niche modeling and climatic simulations, we predicted the species distribution in different future global warming scenarios (2050 and 2070) and estimated the proportion of species range overlapping protected areas through time. Our findings showed a generalized decrease of the potential distribution of A. quadra in the end of 21st century, with the most prominent range loss predicted to occur out of protected areas. Although climate change will potentially drive A. quadra into reserves, the predicted range collapse would be enough to increase its extinction risk from vulnerable, like currently categorized, to the status of critically endangered in accordance to IUCN red list criteria. Taking into account the fragmented and discontinuous landscapes across the Atlantic Forest's hotspot, we propose a conservation strategy for A. quadra based on potential ecological corridors linking climatically suitable areas and discuss the need for amplifying and connecting the current protected areas to maintain this threatened species at longer time under a global warming scenario.},

Species distribution modelling (SDM) could improve our knowledge and inform marine ecosystem management and conservation. Although marine environmental data are available from various sources, there are currently no user-friendly, high-resolution global datasets designed for SDM applications. This study aims to fill this gap by assembling a comprehensive, uniform, high-resolution and readily usable package of global environmental rasters. Location Global, marine. Methods We compiled global coverage data, e.g. satellite-based and in situ measured data, representing various aspects of the marine environment relevant for species distributions. Rasters were assembled at a resolution of 5 arcmin (c. 9.2 km) and a uniform landmask was applied. The utility of the dataset was evaluated by maximum entropy SDM of the invasive seaweed Codium fragile ssp. fragile. Results We present Bio-ORACLE (ocean rasters for analysis of climate and environment), a global dataset consisting of 23 geophysical, biotic and climate rasters. This user-friendly data package for marine species distribution modelling is available for download at http://www.bio-oracle.ugent.be. The high predictive power of the distribution model of C. fragile ssp. fragile clearly illustrates the potential of the data package for SDM of shallow-water marine organisms. Main conclusions The availability of this global environmental data package has the potential to stimulate marine SDM. The high predictive success of the presence-only model of a notorious invasive seaweed shows that the information contained in Bio-ORACLE can be informative about marine distributions and permits building highly accurate species distribution models.},
